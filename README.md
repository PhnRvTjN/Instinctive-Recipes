# Instinctive Recipes

Most people write recipes. I wrote a README. Here’s why.

This project is unapologetically about doing food *properly but better* — not by chasing perfection, but by understanding the logic that makes a dish work. Every framework here is written with warmth and clarity, so you feel guided, not scolded. It’s about honoring roots while leaving space for your own voice.  

Balance is built in: shortcuts are fine, scratch is fine, as long as you know *why* you’re choosing one over the other. Moderation is the key — food should nourish, not exhaust.  

And yes, expect a little playful shade along the way. If you reach for the wrong ingredient, the README will gently roast you — because authenticity matters, and sometimes a little tough love makes the lesson stick.

## What You’ll Find Here
- **Frameworks, not formulas** → Modular, annotated, and open to iteration.  
- **Instinct over measurement** → Trust your senses: taste, aroma, texture, timing.  
- **Roots and branches** → Respect for tradition, space for adaptation.  
- **Balance built in** → From scratch or shortcut, both paths are valid.  
- **Playful rigor** → Serious about flavor, lighthearted in spirit.
