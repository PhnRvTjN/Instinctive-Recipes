# 🥘 Instinctive Indo‑Thai Chicken Curry

*A framework for cooking by feel, not by recipe.*

**Tagline:** No recipe for rice included—if you can’t cook rice, you don’t deserve curry. Haiyaa.

---

## 🥅 Purpose

This is not a recipe in the Western sense. It is a **framework** for building a lean but rich curry that fuses Indian masala logic with Thai flavoring agents. The goal is to teach the *grammar of curry* so that once you understand the sequence and purpose of each step, you’ll never need a recipe again—you’ll cook by instinct.

## ⚙️ Dependencies (Core Concepts)

- **Protein:** Dark meat chicken thighs (bones for depth, skins for fat, diced meat for body).
- **Base:** Onions for body, Thai peppers for fire, tomatoes for acidity.
- **Spices:** Whole → seeds → curry leaves → hing → powders → finishers.
- **Umami:** Oyster + fish sauce (authentic brands only).
- **Creaminess:** Almond milk (or equivalents) as a finishing dial.
- **Heat control:** Medium to render, medium‑high to bloom, medium to build, simmer to unify, low to finish.
- **Waste minimization:** Use bones, render skins, never waste tomato liquid, scrape paste clean.

---

## 🍗 Chicken (Foundation)

- **Why:** Dark meat thighs bring fat, collagen, and flavor. Bones deepen brothiness; skins render fat.
- **How:** Dice meat into popcorn‑sized pieces for even cooking. Reserve bones for depth. Render half the skins for schmaltz.
- **Principle:** Curry should be self‑sufficient in fat and flavor—no bottled oil.
- **Substitution:** Never breast. If vegetarian, swap with firm tofu or mushrooms but keep the fat logic (e.g., coconut cream).

---

## 🧅 Base (Onions, Chilies, Tomatoes)

- **Why:** Onions give body, chilies give fire, tomatoes give acidity and balance.
- **How:** Dice onions fine, sauté until translucent. Add chilies early for integrated heat. Tomatoes simmer until rawness is gone.
- **Principle:** Base = structure. Without it, curry collapses.
- **Substitution:** Any onion works. Thai peppers ideal; serrano lowest fallback (>10,000 SHU). Roma tomatoes preferred; canned acceptable (always use liquid).

---

## 🌿 Spice Logic (Aroma & Backbone)

- **Why:** Spices are layered to unlock aroma without burning.
- **How:** Whole → seeds → curry leaves → hing → powders → finishers.
- **Principle:** Blooming order matters. Each stage builds a chord.
- **Substitution:** Missing one spice is fine; the framework holds. Hing optional but powerful.

---

## 🥛 Creaminess (Rounding Edges)

- **Why:** Creaminess softens acidity and heat, rounds sharp edges.
- **How:** Add only at the end, off heat, in small amounts.
- **Principle:** Creaminess is a dial, not a default.
- **Substitution:** Almond milk unsweetened best. Cashew paste (North Indian tilt), coconut milk (Thai tilt), dairy milk acceptable.

---

## 🐟 Umami (The Lift)

- **Why:** Fish sauce and oyster sauce add depth, salt, and savoriness.
- **How:** Add after tomatoes and powders, simmer gently to meld.
- **Principle:** Umami is the bridge between Indian masala and Thai paste.
- **Substitution:**
  - **Fish sauce:** Squid Brand, Tiparos (Asian market). Avoid supermarket bottles.
  - **Oyster sauce:** Mae Krua (gold standard), Lee Kum Kee Premium (red label). Avoid “Panda” or generic supermarket versions.
  - Soy sauce or anchovy paste only as last‑resort substitutes.

## 🪜 Cooking Sequence (The Ritual)

1. **Render fat (medium heat):**
   - Add half the skins + trimmed fat.
   - Gently render schmaltz. Remove skins before crisping.
   - *Lean principle: no bottled oil.*

2. **Temper (medium‑high):**
   - Add big whole spices → seeds → curry leaves → many pinches of hing.
   - Bloom each briefly until fragrant.

3. **Onions & chilies (medium):**
   - Add finely diced onions, sauté until translucent.
   - Add Thai peppers (any color), diced with seeds. Serrano is the lowest fallback.

4. **Paste bloom (medium‑high):**
   - Add Thai red curry paste (~100 g by feel).
   - **Use only Asian‑market pastes (Mae Ploy, Maesri, or similar with shrimp paste). Avoid Thai Kitchen or Blue Dragon.**
   - Fry until darker and glossy.

5. **Bones & chicken (medium‑high → medium):**
   - Add bones, sear lightly.
   - Add popcorn‑sized chicken thigh pieces, stir until coated and just losing rawness.

6. **Tomatoes (medium → simmer):**
   - Add 4 medium diced Roma (preferred) or 1 can diced with liquid.
   - Always pour in canning liquid and rinse the can with water—don’t waste.
   - Simmer until raw edge is gone.
   - *If curry thickens too much, add water. Always extend simmer after watering to reconcentrate flavors.*

7. **Powdered spices (medium):**
   - Add coriander powder. Cook until fat peeks through.

8. **Umami lift (gentle simmer):**
   - Add oyster sauce + fish sauce (authentic brands only).
   - Let meld for 3–5 minutes.

9. **Finish (low / residual heat):**
   - Add black pepper + garam masala.
   - Taste. If sharp, swirl in almond milk slowly (2–4 tbsp, max 1/4 cup).
   - Scatter chopped coriander leaves.

## ♻️ Waste Minimization

- Render skins for fat, not crisp.
- Use bones for depth.
- Always use tomato liquid and rinse water.
- Scrape curry paste clean into the pot.

## 🧭 Meta‑Lesson

Curry is not a formula—it’s a grammar. Once you understand the sequence (fat → aroma → base → paste → protein → acid → powders → umami → finish), you can improvise endlessly. The framework is reproducible, but the flavor is always alive.
