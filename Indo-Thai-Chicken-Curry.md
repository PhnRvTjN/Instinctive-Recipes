# 🥘 Indo-Thai Chicken Curry v1.1

*A framework for cooking curry by feel, not by recipe.*

**Tagline:** No recipe for rice included - if you can't cook rice, you don't deserve curry. Haiyaa.

---

## 🥅 Purpose

This is not a recipe in the Western sense. It is a **framework** for building a lean but rich curry that fuses Indian masala logic with Thai flavoring agents. The goal is to teach the *grammar of curry* so that once you understand the sequence and purpose of each step, you'll never need a recipe again - you'll cook by instinct.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Ingredient substitutions, shortcuts, and improvisations will alter the curry. That's fine - we're not chasing an exact replica; we're chasing the *feel* of how a good curry is made. Learn the logic, trust your senses, and let the pot tell you when it's right.

⚠️ **Strict no-nos (read before you start):**

- No bottled oil - render your own fat.
- Anything below a Serrano is way too mild. Don't deseed, and always use the right amount.
- No ketchup in place of tomatoes.
- No curry powder packets - raw dust ≠ curry.
- No supermarket “Panda” oyster sauce or generic fish sauce.
- No skim milk, no sweetened almond milk, no vanilla-flavoured almond milk - curry not dessert.
- Parsley ≠ Cilantro/Coriander Leaves
- No microwaving the curry. Ever (except for reheating leftovers).

*Pedagogy up front, swagger in standards, warmth in reassurance, moderation in balance, and playful roast when you stray - that's the house tone throughout.*

## ⚙️ Dependencies (Core Concepts)

- **Protein:** Dark meat chicken thighs (bones for depth, skins for fat, diced meat for body).
- **Base:** Onions for body, Thai peppers for fire, tomatoes for acidity.
- **Spices:** Whole → seeds → curry leaves → hing → powders → finishers.
- **Umami:** Oyster + fish sauce (authentic brands only).
- **Creaminess:** Almond milk (or equivalents) as a finishing dial.
- **Heat control:** Medium to render, medium-high to bloom, medium to build, simmer to unify, low to finish.
- **Waste minimization:** Use bones, render skins, never waste tomato liquid, scrape paste clean.

*Respect the sequence. Dumping everything at once is stew, not curry.*

## 🍗 Chicken (Foundation)

- **Why:** ~3 lbs bone-in, skin-on thighs bring fat, collagen, and flavor. Bones deepen brothiness; skins render fat. Breast meat dries out and betrays the curry's richness.
- **How:** Dice meat into popcorn-sized pieces for even cooking. Reserve bones for depth. Render half the skins for schmaltz.
- **Principle:** Curry should be self-sufficient in fat and flavor - no bottled oil.
- **Substitution:** Never breast. If vegetarian, swap with firm tofu or mushrooms but keep the fat logic (e.g., coconut cream).
- **Instinct cue:** Chicken should just lose its raw sheen, coated in spice and fat, before you move on.

❌ **Strict no-no:** Boneless skinless breast. Wrong bird part, wrong logic.
*Respect the ingredient; don't strip it of the very thing that makes curry sing.*

---

## 🧅 Base (Onions, Chilies, Tomatoes)

- **Why:** 2 medium-large onions for body, 9-12 Thai peppers for fire, 4 Roma tomatoes (or 1 can with liquid) for acidity and balance.
- **How:** Dice onions fine, sauté until translucent. Add chilies (*with seeds*)early for integrated heat. Simmer tomatoes until rawness is gone.
- **Principle:** Base = structure. Without it, curry collapses.
- **Substitution:** Any onion works. Thai peppers ideal; serrano lowest fallback (>10,000 SHU). Canned tomatoes acceptable (always use liquid).
- **Instinct cue:** The kitchen should smell rounded, not raw; onions soft, chilies fragrant, tomatoes melted into sauce.

❌ **Strict no-no:** Never deseed chillies. No Ketchup. Curry not McDonald's.
*Dice properly, cook patiently, use the right amount - this is the foundation, not an afterthought.*

---

## 🌿 Spice Logic (Aroma & Backbone)

- **Why:** Whole spices (~1 tsp cinnamon, cardamom pods, cloves, star anise; 2-3 bay leaves), seeds (~1 tsp cumin, mustard), curry leaves (~1 tbsp dried or a handful fresh), hing (many pinches), powders (~1 tsp turmeric, red chili, coriander).
- **How:** Whole → seeds → curry leaves → hing → powders → finishers. Bloom each until fragrant.
- **Principle:** Blooming order matters. Each stage builds a chord. Dumping all at once is stew, not curry.
- **Substitution:** Missing one spice is fine; the framework holds. Hing optional but powerful. Freshly ground is better - don't let perfect stop you from cooking.
- **Instinct cue:** The pot should smell layered: the harshness lifts, aromatics feel rounded, and the paste turns glossy and alive.

❌ **Strict no-no:** Curry powder packets. Yellow dust ≠ curry.
*Raw spice is dust; cooked spice is depth. Let each note sing before the next joins.*

---

## 🥛 Creaminess (Rounding Edges)

- **Why:** Creaminess softens acidity and heat, rounds sharp edges.
- **How:** Add almond milk (2-4 tbsp, max ¼ cup) only at the end, off heat, in small amounts.
- **Principle:** Creaminess is a dial, not a default. It should carry flavor, not bury it.
- **Substitution:** Almond milk (unsweetened) best. Cashew paste (North Indian tilt), coconut milk (Thai tilt), dairy milk acceptable. Experiment with any milk - just know what it does (fat enriches, proteins can split, sugars can scorch).
- **Instinct cue:** Sauce should feel lush but not heavy, glossy but not greasy.

❌ **Strict no-nos:** Skim milk, sweetened almond milk, vanilla-flavoured almond milk. Too much almond milk? Curry not dessert.
*Add just enough to round; if you drown, you silence the choir.*

---

## 🐟 Umami (The Lift)

- **Why:** Fish sauce (~1 tsp) and oyster sauce (~1 tsp) add depth, salt, and savoriness.
- **How:** Add after tomatoes and powders, simmer gently to meld.
- **Principle:** Umami is the bridge between Indian masala and Thai paste.
- **Substitution:**
  - **Fish sauce:** Squid Brand, Tiparos (Asian market). Avoid supermarket bottles.
  - **Oyster sauce:** Mae Krua (gold standard), Lee Kum Kee Premium (red label). Avoid “Panda” or generic.
  - Soy sauce or anchovy paste only as last-resort substitutes.
- **Instinct cue:** Taste should rise and widen, not tilt salty - a savory lift that feels inevitable.

❌ **Strict no-no:** Worcestershire sauce. Wrong continent.
*Use the good stuff - authenticity isn't snobbery, it's accuracy.*

## 🪜 Cooking Sequence (The Ritual)

1. **Render fat (medium):** Half the skins + trimmed fat. Gently render schmaltz. Remove skins before crisping.
   - **Instinct cue:** Pot should smell nutty, not greasy; fat pools clear, not foamy.
   ❌ **No-no:** Bottled oil. Let the chicken pay its own way.

2. **Temper (medium-high):** Whole spices → seeds → curry leaves → hing. Bloom each until fragrant.
   - **Instinct cue:** Each spice pops into aroma; add the next only when the first sings.
   ❌ **No-no:** Throwing everything in cold. That's noise, not music.

3. **Onions & chilies (medium):** Add onions, sauté until translucent. Add chilies.
   - **Instinct cue:** Onions soft and sweet; chilies hot but not acrid.
   ❌ **No-no:** Raw onion chunks. Dice properly.

4. **Paste bloom (medium-high):** Add ~100 g Thai red curry paste (Mae Ploy/Maesri only). Fry until darker and glossy.
   - **Instinct cue:** Paste turns brick-red, glossy; oil peeks through.
   ❌ **No-no:** Thai Kitchen or Blue Dragon. Use real paste with shrimp paste.

5. **Bones & chicken (medium-high → medium):** Add bones, sear lightly. Add chicken, stir until just losing rawness.
   - **Instinct cue:** Chicken opaque, edges firming, coated in spice and fat.
   ❌ **No-no:** Overbrowning - this is curry, not grilled skewers.

6. **Tomatoes (medium → simmer):** Add 4 Roma or 1 can diced with liquid. Rinse can with water; don't waste. Simmer until raw edge is gone.
   - **Instinct cue:** Bright acidity mellows; sauce thickens but stays lively.
   ❌ **No-no:** Ketchup, again. Respect the base.

7. **Powdered spices (medium):** Add coriander powder (~1 tsp). Cook until fat peeks through.
   - **Instinct cue:** Surface glistens with spice-tinted oil; aroma deepens.
   ❌ **No-no:** Dumping all powders earlier; they burn or go muddy.

8. **Umami lift (gentle simmer):** Add oyster + fish sauce (~1 tsp each). Let meld 3-5 minutes.
   - **Instinct cue:** Taste spreads wider; salt feels integrated, not loud.
   ❌ **No-no:** Salting heavily before umami - you'll overshoot.

9. **Finish (low):** Add black pepper (~½ tsp) + garam masala (~½ tsp). Taste. If sharp, swirl in almond milk (2-4 tbsp). Scatter coriander leaves.
   - **Instinct cue:** Curry feels complete; the last swirl calms edges without muting spice.
   ❌ **No-no:** Dousing with milk. Curry not dessert.

*Slow down, listen to the pot. Each stage earns the next.*

## ♻️ Waste Minimization

- Render skins for fat, not crisp.
- Use bones for depth.
- Always use tomato liquid and rinse water.
- Scrape curry paste clean into the pot.

*Waste less, taste more. Flavor rides in the bits people throw away; don't send it to the bin. If you toss the tomato liquid… haiyaa.*

---

## 🧭 Meta-Lesson

Curry is not a formula - it's a grammar. Once you understand the sequence (fat → aroma → base → paste → protein → acid → powders → umami → finish), you can improvise endlessly. The framework is reproducible, but the flavor is always alive.

*Respect the grammar, then riff. Balance is the rule beneath the rules. Skip steps and the sentence breaks; follow them and it sings.*
